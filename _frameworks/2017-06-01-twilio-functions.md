features:
  - No servers to manage - Twilio will handle the servers and infrastructure, so you can focus on learning, prototyping, and deploying to production faster than ever.
  - Lower latency - By running your code directly on Twilio, you’ll minimize the time it takes for your instructions to reach Twilio — creating the best possible experience for your users.
  - Complete runtime environment - Functions are a part of Twilio Runtime — a pre-configured environment with helper libraries, API keys, assets, and debugging tools that you’ll require for your code.

long-description: "Create a function using JavaScript, then Twilio will execute it in a standard Node.js runtime environment. Twilio will run and scale your function automatically based on the incoming requests.  Pricing is based on the total number of requests, so you’ll never pay for idle server time."
