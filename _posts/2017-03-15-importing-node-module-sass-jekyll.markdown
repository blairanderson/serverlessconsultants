I love using jekyll and OSS to build badass web projects.

This site obviously uses tachyons.io and is built with jekyll.

First, using NPM download tachyons.

`npm install tachyons-sass --save`

Make sure you have a main SCSS file.

`css/main.scss`

That scss file should have frontmatter.

```
---
# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
---
@charset "utf-8";
... the rest of your styles here
```

Now since you have imported tachyons from node, you can add it from the import.

```
---
# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
---
@charset "utf-8";

@import "../node_modules/tachyons-sass/tachyons.scss";
```
