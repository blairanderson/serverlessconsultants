Welcome! Thank you for visiting Serverless Frameworks Directory!

My name is Blair Anderson, founder of Serverless Consultants in Seattle.

Iâ€™d like to take the opportunity to share a little bit about the origins of this resource for Serverless.

After first learning about HEROKU, i knew it would be a significant player in the web developement world. The reason being that it automated a huge job that typically required human knowledge and expertise.

Serverless has continued on to extract more and more, down to AWS lambda and Google Cloud offering functions-as-a-service.
