# serverless-add-api-key
[![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com)

A [serverless](http://www.serverless.com) plugin to create api key and usage pattern (if they don't already exist) and associate them to the Rest Api.
Serverless provides this functionality natively but it doesn't allow you to associate multiple services with same apiKey and usage plan.
This plugin associates your Serverless service with same api key if the key already exists. Also works with multiple keys.

The plugin supports serverless stages, so you can create key(s) with different name in different stage.

*__P.S.__ The plugin by default displays the created key and value on the console. If you wish to avoid that then specify `--conceal` option with `sls deploy` command*

## Install

`npm install --save-dev serverless-add-api-key`

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-add-api-key
```

## Configuration

### Specifying key(s) and let AWS auto set the value.
```yaml
custom:
  apiKeys:
    dev: # dev is the default stage, so even if you don't use stages please specify the key names under dev
      - name: name1
      - name: name2
    prod:
      - name: name1
    other-stage-name:
      - name: name5

```

### Specifying key values.

```yaml
custom:
  apiKeys:
    dev: # dev is the default stage, so even if you don't use stages please specify the key names and values under dev
      - name: SomeKey
        value: your-api-key-that-is-at-least-20-characters-long
      - name: KeyFromSlsVariables
        value: ${opt:MyKey}
      - SomeOtherKeyThatAssignsRandomValue
```
Code automatically creates usage plan called `<api-key-name>-usage-plan`.
