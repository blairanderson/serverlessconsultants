    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Serverless Directory was created to help people find plugins more easily. </h2>
    <p>I was inspired by a few great websites that exist to help developers be more efficient. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The late <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/" rel="nofollow">Ruby Toolbox</a> always gave a super quick way to browse through plugins by category. </li>
      <li>Am basically trying to do what StaticGen did for static site generators.</li>
    </ul>

        <dd class="f6 fw4 ml0">How do I add a Plugin to the listing?</dd>
        <dd class="f3 fw6 ml0"></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="lh-title">
        <dd class="f6 fw4 ml0">My plugin is here, how do I add categories?</dd>
        <dd class="f3 fw6 ml0">Add <a href="https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics" rel="nofollow">Topics to your GitHub Repo</a> to have them added here</dd>
