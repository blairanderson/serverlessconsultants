* Automatically attach layers for each lambda function
* Creates a new layer version when `package.json` was updated
* If package.json was not changed, it does not publish a new layer
* Reduces drastically lambda size
* It reduces deployment time.
* Share same layers (libraries) with all lambda functions

## Requirements

* Serverless >= 1.34.0 (layers support)
* Node >= v6.10.3
* NPM >= 3.10.10
* AWS only (sorry)
* A valid package.json file

`npm install -D serverless-layers`

## Serverless configuration

  exclude:
    - node_modules/**
  excludeDevDependencies: true

plugins:
  - serverless-layers
