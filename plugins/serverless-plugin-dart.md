## 📦 Install

Install the plugin inside your serverless project with npm.

```sh
$ npm i -D serverless-dart
```

💡 The `-D` flag adds it to your development dependencies in npm speak

💡 This plugin assumes you are using [Dart Runtime for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-dart-runtime) coding your applications.

Add the following to your serverless project's `serverless.yml` file

```yaml
service: hello
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: dart
plugins:
  # this registers the plugin
  # with serverless
  - serverless-dart
# creates one artifact for each function
package:
  individually: true
functions:
  hello:
    # the first part of the handler refers to the script lib/main.dart.
    # main.hello identifies the handler to execute in the Dart runtime.
    # The runtime supports multiple handlers
    # The plugin is smart to not rebuild those scripts with multiple handlers.
    handler: main.hello
    events:
      - http:
          path: /hello
          method: GET
```

> 💡 The Dart Runtime for AWS Lambda requires a binary named `bootstrap`. This plugin renames the binary `dart2native` builds to `bootstrap` for you and zips that file.

The default behavior is to build your Lambda inside a Docker container. Make sure you [get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## 🤸 Usage

Every [serverless workflow command](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/workflow/) should work out of the box.

### package your Lambdas

```sh
$ npx serverless deploy
```

### deploy your Lambdas

```sh
$ npx serverless deploy
```
