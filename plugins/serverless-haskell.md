Deploying Haskell code onto [AWS Lambda] using [Serverless].

## Requirements

* AWS account
* [Stack]
* [NPM]
* [Docker] unless running on a Linux host

## Usage

* Create a [Stack] package for your code:

  ```shell
  stack new mypackage
  ```

  LTS 9, 10 and 11 are supported, older versions are likely to work too but
  untested.

* Initialise a Serverless project inside the Stack package directory and install
  the `serverless-haskell` plugin:

  ```shell
  cd mypackage
  npm init .
  npm install --save serverless serverless-haskell
  ```

* Create `serverless.yml` with the following contents:

  ```yaml
  service: myservice

  provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: nodejs8.10

  functions:
    myfunc:
      handler: mypackage.myfunc
      # Here, mypackage is the Haskell package name and myfunc is the executable
      # name as defined in the Cabal file. The handler field may be prefixed
      # with a path of the form `dir1/.../dirn`, relative to `serverless.yml`,
      # which points to the location where the Haskell package `mypackage` is
      # defined. This prefix is not needed when the Stack project is defined at
      # the same level as `serverless.yml`.

  plugins:
    - serverless-haskell
  ```

* Write your `main` function:

  ```haskell
  import qualified Data.Aeson as Aeson

  import AWSLambda

  main = lambdaMain handler

  handler :: Aeson.Value -> IO [Int]
  handler evt = do
    putStrLn "This should go to logs"
    print evt
    pure [1, 2, 3]
  ```

* Use `sls deploy` to deploy the executable to AWS Lambda. **Note**: `sls deploy
  function` is [not supported yet](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell/issues/20).

  The `serverless-haskell` plugin will build the package using Stack and upload
  it to AWS together with a JavaScript wrapper to pass the input and output
  from/to AWS Lambda.

  You can test the function and see the invocation results with `sls invoke
  myfunc`.

### Notes

* `sls deploy function` is [not supported yet](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell/issues/20).
* `sls invoke local` is [not supported yet](https://github.com/seek-oss/serverless-haskell/issues/32).
* Only AWS Lambda is supported at the moment. Other cloud providers would
  require different JavaScript wrappers to be implemented.

See
[AWSLambda](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell/docs/AWSLambda.html)
for documentation, including additional options to control the deployment.

## Testing

* Haskell code is tested with Stack: `stack test`.
* JavaScript code is linted with `eslint`.

### Integration tests

Integration test verifies that the project can build and deploy a complete
function to AWS, and it runs with expected functionality.

Integration test is only automatically run up to deployment due to the need for
an AWS account. To run manually:

* Ensure you have the required dependencies: `curl`, [jq], [NPM], `pwgen` and
  [Stack].
* Get an AWS account and add the access credentials into your shell environment.
* Run `./integration-test/run.sh`. The exit code indicates success.
* To verify just the packaging, without deployment, run
  `./integration-test/run.sh --dry-run`.
* By default, the integration test is run with LTS 11. To specify a different
series, use `RESOLVER_SERIES=lts-9`.

## Releasing

* Run the integration tests.
* Install [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion): `pip install bumpversion`.
* Run `bumpversion major|minor|patch`.
* Run `git push --tags && git push`.
